# Image Search Abstraction Layer

This requires a MongoDB database (let's say 'fcc').

This project will also need an API key from Google custom search and a custom search ID. You can follow [this tutorial](URL "https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse") to get them.

Use a .env file to store the url to the MongoDB database, the port to connect, the API key and the search ID (MONGO, PORT, API and ID variables respectively).
